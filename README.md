# phase-sensitive-radar-processing
For storing, creating, and modifying code to process (A)pRES data

## To do (2021-10-29)
1. Look through three fmcw code packages and choose which one to use as our base (likely ApRES_Utils_Nicholls_250221, with some input from Matlab_fmcw_2018_case_update)
2. Decide on a protocol for updating, branching, & merging code, as well as keeping track of updates (e.g. through built-in Github projects tab)
3. Create file structure

## Changelog

### 2021-10-29
(EHC) Updated four folders of fmcw processing code
1. `ApRES_Python_Nicholls_2021` - plots ApRES data in python, from Keith Nicholls in March 2021
2. `ApRES_Utils_Nicholls_250221` - fmcw code from Keith Nicholls in March 2021
3. `Matlab_fmcwSuite2018` - fmcw code from Pierre Dutrieux from 2018
4. `Matlab_fmcw_2018_case_update` - updated version of (3) by Case in 2019, mostly in regards to expanded plotting properties and some processing of the Juneau Icefield 2018 data
